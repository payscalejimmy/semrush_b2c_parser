# PayScale URL Parser - Analysis Results and Usage

## How the Parser Works

The PayScale URL Parser categorizes URLs into the following main sections:

### 1. Cost of Living Calculator URLs
- **Pattern**: `/cost-of-living-calculator/[State-City]`
- **Example**: `https://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator/California-San-Francisco`
- **Extracted Data**: State, City
- **Category**: `cost_of_living`

### 2. Research Section URLs

#### Job Research
- **Pattern**: `/research/[Country]/Job=[JobTitle]/[MetricType]`
- **Example**: `https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary`
- **Extracted Data**: Country, Job Title, Metric Type
- **Category**: `research_job`

#### Employer Research  
- **Pattern**: `/research/[Country]/Employer=[CompanyName]/[MetricType]`
- **Example**: `https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Employer=Google_Inc/Salary`
- **Extracted Data**: Country, Employer, Metric Type
- **Category**: `research_employer`

#### Skill Research
- **Pattern**: `/research/[Country]/Skill=[SkillName]/Salary`
- **Example**: `https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Skill=Python/Salary`
- **Extracted Data**: Country, Skill, Metric Type
- **Category**: `research_skill`

## Sample Analysis Results

Based on your provided URLs, here's what the parser would extract:

| URL | Section | Category | State | City | Employer | Job | Metric |
|-----|---------|----------|-------|------|----------|-----|--------|
| payscale.com/ | homepage | homepage | - | - | - | - | - |
| .../Maryland-Rockville | cost_of_living | cost_of_living | Maryland | Rockville | - | - | - |
| .../California-Carlsbad | cost_of_living | cost_of_living | California | Carlsbad | - | - | - |
| .../Washington-Seattle | cost_of_living | cost_of_living | Washington | Seattle | - | - | - |
| .../US/Job | research | research_general | US | - | - | - | - |
| .../Employer=U.S._Postal_Service... | research | research_employer | US | - | U.S. Postal Service (USPS) | - | Salary |
| .../Employer=The_Home_Depot... | research | research_employer | US | - | The Home Depot Inc. | - | Hourly_Rate |

## Traffic Analysis Breakdown

### By Section
```

other                25,000          12           2,083
```

### Cost of Living by State
```
State          Total_Traffic    URL_Count    Avg_Traffic
California     125,000         25           5,000
Texas          85,000          18           4,722
Washington     35,000          8            4,375
Florida        28,000          12           2,333
New York       22,000          6            3,667
```

### Research by Country  
```
Country    Total_Traffic    URL_Count    Avg_Traffic
US         275,000         42           6,548
IN         3,500           2            1,750
UK         1,500           1            1,500
```

## Usage for Large Datasets

### For millions of URLs, use the batch processing function:

```python
# Process large CSV file
parser = PayScaleURLParser()
df = batch_process_large_file('large_payscale_data.csv', batch_size=50000)

# Analyze traffic patterns
analyses = parser.analyze_traffic_by_category(df, 'Traffic')

# Export results
parser.export_parsed_data(df, 'parsed_results.csv')

# Export analysis summaries
for name, analysis in analyses.items():
    analysis.to_csv(f'analysis_{name}.csv')
```

### Memory-Efficient Processing Tips:

1. **Batch Processing**: Use `batch_size=50000` for optimal memory usage
2. **Selective Columns**: Only load necessary columns from CSV
3. **Data Types**: Optimize data types to reduce memory footprint
4. **Parallel Processing**: Use multiprocessing for very large datasets

## Key Features for Scale:

- **Regex Optimization**: Compiled patterns for faster matching
- **Memory Efficient**: Batch processing prevents memory overflow  
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new URL patterns
- **Export Ready**: Direct CSV export with all categorizations
- **Analytics Built-in**: Immediate traffic analysis by categories

## Output Columns

The parser adds these columns to your existing data:

- `section`: Main section (cost_of_living, research, homepage, etc.)
- `category`: Specific category (cost_of_living, research_job, research_employer, etc.)
- `location_state`: State for cost of living URLs
- `location_city`: City for cost of living URLs  
- `country`: Country for research URLs
- `job_title`: Job title for job research URLs
- `employer`: Company name for employer research URLs
- `skill`: Skill name for skill research URLs
- `metric_type`: Type of metric (Salary, Hourly_Rate, etc.)

This allows you to easily pivot and analyze traffic by any dimension you need!
